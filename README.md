# Image Classification with a Neural Network Built from Scratch using NumPy

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a basic feedforward neural network using only NumPy. The model is designed to classify different fruits, such as apples, mangos, rasberries and lemons, based on their images from the **Fruits-360** dataset.

## Model Architecture
The neural network consists of:
- **Input Layer**: Takes the flattened image as input.
- **Hidden Layers**: Includes fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: Uses softmax for multi-class classification.
